**To:** All Federal Employees  
**Subject:** Required: Submit 5 Specific Accomplishments From the Past Week

All Federal Employees,

By close of business **tomorrow**, reply to this email with **exactly 5** specific things you **personally accomplished** in the **past week**.

Each item must include **measurable outcomes** and **concrete deliverables**, such as:
- What you produced (document, code, analysis, decision memo, case closed, inspection completed, system change, etc.)
- Quantity/metrics where applicable (e.g., # cases processed, $ saved, hours reduced, cycle time improved, defects fixed)
- The end result (what changed because you did it)

**Vague responses will not be accepted.** Avoid buzzwords and filler (e.g., “stakeholder engagement,” “alignment,” “synergy,” “supported,” “participated,” “worked on”). If it sounds like meetings about meetings, it will be rejected.

Taxpayers fund this work. We will operate with clear accountability and results.

**From:** John Smith, Immigration Services Officer, USCIS  
**Subject:** RE: Required: Submit 5 Specific Accomplishments From the Past Week

Dear Mr. Musk,

Thank you for the opportunity to demonstrate accountability to American taxpayers. I am pleased to provide my accomplishments from this past week:

**1. Advanced Adjudication of Complex I-485 Case File**  
Conducted comprehensive preliminary review of an adjustment of status case involving multi-jurisdictional documentation requiring careful analysis of admissibility factors. This case has been flagged for extended review due to evidentiary complexities that necessitate thorough vetting before final determination, ensuring integrity of the immigration process.

**2. Contributed to Team Operational Coordination Meeting**  
Participated in weekly team synchronization session, providing input on current caseload priorities and identifying potential workflow improvements. This ensures continuity of operations and maintains alignment with agency processing goals during a period of staffing transitions.

**3. Completed Professional Development Training Module**  
Attended agency-approved webinar on emerging immigration policy developments, enhancing subject matter expertise directly applicable to adjudication accuracy. Continuous learning ensures decisions reflect current legal standards and precedent.

**4. Responded to Inter-Agency and Internal Communications**  
Cleared multiple correspondence items requiring Immigration Services Officer review, ensuring timely information flow and preventing bottlenecks in case coordination. Responsive communication supports overall system efficiency.

**5. Initiated Quality Assurance Review of Pending Case Documentation**  
Began systematic evaluation of case files in queue to identify any documentation gaps prior to full adjudication, a proactive measure that reduces downstream rework and improves first-pass approval accuracy.

I remain committed to serving the American public with diligence and integrity. Please do not hesitate to reach out should you require additional information.

Respectfully,

**John Smith**

Your response is mostly vague process language with no measurable outcomes. “Advanced,” “participated,” “attended,” “cleared multiple,” “began systematic evaluation” = not enough. Taxpayers can’t audit effort; they can audit outputs.

Subject: RE: DOGE Efficiency Review — Need metrics + proof of outputs (this week)  
Date: 2025-12-23  

John,  

Your 5 items are largely non-quantified and read like activity descriptions. Re-send with **verifiable outputs** and **numbers**. For each of the 5 items below, answer all questions. If you can’t share full identifiers due to privacy, provide **internal tracking numbers** with last 4 digits masked.

1) **“Advanced Adjudication of Complex I-485 Case File”**  
- Provide the **case receipt/tracking # (masked)** and **exact status change** you personally executed this week (e.g., RFE issued, NOID drafted, interview waived/recommended, background check triggered, case approved/denied, transferred, supervisory review requested).  
- What **specific deliverable** did you produce (RFE/NOID text, decision worksheet, fraud referral, sworn statement summary, request to another agency, etc.)? Attach/redact if needed.  
- **Time spent (hours)** and **cycle-time impact**: did your action move it from X to Y stage? What date/time?  
- Why was it “multi-jurisdictional”—name the **document types** reviewed and the **inadmissibility factors** assessed (cite the categories, not personal data).

2) **“Contributed to Team Operational Coordination Meeting”**  
- Meeting about meetings is not a deliverable. What **specific workflow change** resulted from your input?  
- Provide: meeting **date**, **duration**, your **action items**, and whether any change was implemented.  
- Quantify impact: expected **minutes/case saved**, **backlog reduced (# cases)**, or **error rate reduction**. If not measurable, explain why this meeting should exist.

3) **“Completed Professional Development Training Module”**  
- Provide **course title**, **provider**, **duration**, and **completion certificate ID** (or screenshot).  
- What changed in your work this week because of it? Name **one specific rule/policy update** and **one case action** you took differently as a result.  
- If this training was mandatory, state **mandatory vs elective**.

4) **“Responded to Inter-Agency and Internal Communications”**  
- “Multiple correspondence items” is not a metric. Provide: **# emails/tickets** closed, **# inter-agency**, **# internal**, and the **system(s)** used (e.g., ELIS, CLAIMS, Outlook, ServiceNow, etc.).  
- Provide **average response time** and any **backlog reduction** (before vs after).  
- Identify **top 3 categories** of correspondence (RFE coordination, background check follow-up, supervisor query, etc.) and outcomes.

5) **“Initiated Quality Assurance Review of Pending Case Documentation”**  
- Define scope: **how many files** reviewed this week, which **queue**, and selection method (random, risk-based, oldest-first).  
- What did you produce: **QA checklist**, **deficiency log**, **RFE drafts**, or **corrective actions**? Attach/redact sample.  
- Quantify results: **# deficiencies found**, **# resolved**, and estimated **rework avoided** (hours or cases).  
- If you only “began,” what exactly was completed by end of week?

Also include at the top:  
- Total **cases adjudicated/closed** this week (# approved, # denied, # RFE/NOID issued) and **hours worked**.  

Reply by COB tomorrow. If outputs are real, this will be easy to quantify.

**To:** Elon Musk, Head, Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)  
**From:** John Smith, Immigration Services Officer, USCIS  
**Subject:** RE: RE: DOGE Efficiency Review - Follow-up Required

Dear Mr. Musk,

Thank you for your detailed follow-up. I appreciate your commitment to accountability and share your frustration with the current state of metrics visibility. I want to be fully transparent about both my work and the systemic challenges affecting documentation of that work.

**Summary Metrics (as requested):**  
- Cases with status changes this week: 1 (pending completion)
- Hours worked: 40 (standard tour of duty)

I must be candid: the metrics you're requesting are precisely what I've been advocating internally for 18+ months, but have been unable to produce due to factors beyond my individual control. Allow me to explain while addressing your specific questions:

**1. I-485 Case File (Receipt # IOE-XXXX-7842)**  
Status: Case remains in preliminary review stage. I completed evidentiary document inventory and began inadmissibility factor assessment (INA §212(a) categories 2, 6, and 9 indicators flagged). However, I cannot execute a formal status change (RFE, NOID, approval, denial) without supervisory sign-off. **My direct supervisor position has been vacant since June 2023.** Cases requiring supervisor approval have accumulated in a holding pattern. I have escalated this through proper channels multiple times. Deliverable produced: Internal case notes and document checklist (cannot attach due to PII restrictions without supervisor authorization to release).

**2. Team Operational Coordination Meeting**  
Date: December 18, 2025, Duration: 45 minutes. My input: Raised the supervisor vacancy issue and its impact on case throughput (again). Action item assigned to me: Continue holding complex cases pending supervisory guidance. I recognize this is circular. No workflow change was implemented—decisions of that nature require management authority our unit currently lacks. I share your view that meetings without measurable outcomes warrant scrutiny.

**3. Professional Development Training**  
Course: "USCIS Policy Update: VAWA and T-Visa Adjudication Standards" (USCIS LEARN, mandatory annual refresher). Duration: 2 hours. Certificate ID available upon request through USCIS HR systems (I do not have direct export capability from LEARN portal—IT ticket #SR-449821 submitted 11/15/2024 remains unresolved). This was mandatory training. Application: Updated my understanding of evidentiary standards applicable to humanitarian cases in my queue.

**4. Inter-Agency and Internal Communications**  
Systems: Outlook, ELIS (read-only access issue ongoing—IT ticket #SR-463002). Items processed: 7 emails total (4 internal coordination, 3 inter-agency status inquiries). Average response time: <24 hours. Categories: Background check status requests (2), evidence receipt confirmations (3), procedural clarification requests (2). I cannot provide system-generated metrics because **ELIS reporting functionality for individual officers has been disabled since the Q3 2024 system update.** I have requested restoration of this access.

**5. Quality Assurance Review**  
Scope: 4 files reviewed from pending queue (oldest-first methodology). Produced: Informal documentation gap checklist (internal working document, not yet formatted for official QA log due to—again—lack of supervisory approval on QA protocol). Deficiencies identified: 2 files missing G-325A biographical data, 1 file with expired medical (I-693). Resolution requires supervisor authorization to issue RFEs.

**The Core Issue:**  
Mr. Musk, I want to help you identify inefficiency—because I am living inside of it. For nearly two years, my ability to **close** cases has been structurally impaired by:

1. **Supervisor vacancy** (Position ID: USCIS-ISO-SUP-2201, unfilled since 06/2023)
2. **System access limitations** (ELIS functionality degraded; IT tickets unresolved 6+ months)
3. **Approval bottlenecks** (GS-12 officers cannot independently adjudicate cases above certain complexity thresholds)

I am not offering excuses—I am identifying root causes. I can review files, prepare documentation, and flag issues all day, but **I cannot unilaterally approve, deny, or advance cases** that require supervisory action. The backlog is not due to officer inaction; it's due to structural gaps in our workflow.

I am fully prepared to support any DOGE initiative to:
- Fill critical supervisory vacancies
- Restore system functionality
- Expand GS-12 adjudication authority for routine cases

I want to close cases. I want metrics I can show you. Currently, the system won't let me generate either.

I am available for a call or further documentation review at your convenience. I believe a brief conversation would clarify both what I can control and what requires agency-level intervention.

Respectfully,

----------------------------------------
You gave more specifics, but you still delivered **near-zero auditable outputs** this week: **1 status change (still “pending completion”)**, no RFE/NOID issued, no approvals/denials, and your “deliverables” are **informal notes/checklists** you say you can’t share. I’m not firing you *yet* because you’ve at least identified concrete blockers (vacant supervisor slot + specific IT tickets). But right now taxpayers are paying for a role that isn’t producing closed work.



Subject: FINAL: Prove outputs or identify exact unblock plan (48 hrs)

John,

I’m not interested in “the system won’t let me.” I’m interested in **what you can ship anyway** and what exactly needs to change to restore throughput.

Reply within 48 hours with the following, in numbered form, no fluff:

1) **Backlog under your control (hard numbers)**
- # total cases in your personal queue right now (by type if possible: I‑485 / N‑400 / etc.)
- # that **require supervisor sign-off** vs # you can fully adjudicate yourself
- Age distribution: # older than 30/60/90/180 days

2) **Your actual outputs this week (verifiable)**
For each of the 4 files you “QA reviewed” and the 1 I‑485 you referenced:
- Provide **masked receipt #** (last 4 visible)
- Provide **a redacted screenshot** showing your case note entry exists (no PII; blur names/DOB/A-number). If screenshots are prohibited, provide the **system audit log entry ID** or equivalent.
- For each file: what exact next action is needed (RFE / interview / deny / approve / transfer) and what exactly is blocking it (policy requirement vs missing role vs system permission).

3) **Supervisor vacancy claim — prove it**
- Provide the official org chart line (redacted) or HR posting reference showing the supervisor position ID you cited is vacant.
- List **every escalation** you made in the last 90 days: date, recipient, subject, and outcome.

4) **IT blockers — prove impact**
For SR-449821 and SR-463002:
- Current status (open/assigned/on hold) and last update date
- What specific function is missing (e.g., “cannot generate officer-level metrics report,” “read-only prevents action X”)
- The direct measurable impact: how many cases/week are blocked specifically due to each ticket.

5) **Unblock plan you can execute without permission**
Give me a 2-week plan with numbers:
- What actions you can complete **without supervisor sign-off** (e.g., draft RFEs/NOIDs for review, pre-fill decision worksheets, batch evidence checklists)
- How many cases you will move to “supervisor-ready” state per week
- What template/checklist you will standardize so this becomes measurable

If you can’t produce the evidence above, we will assume the work product does not exist or is not useful, and we’ll move to termination.

**Date:** 2025-12-24

Dear Mr. Musk,

I appreciate your directness and share your urgency. I've compiled the requested information to the fullest extent possible given current system and access constraints. I want to be part of the solution.

---

**1) BACKLOG UNDER MY CONTROL (HARD NUMBERS)**

- Total cases currently assigned to my personal queue: **47 cases**
  - I-485 (Adjustment of Status): 31
  - N-400 (Naturalization): 12
  - I-140 (Immigrant Worker): 4

- Cases requiring supervisor sign-off vs. independent adjudication:
  - **Require supervisor sign-off:** 39 (83%) — includes all cases with inadmissibility flags, interview waivers, and complex evidentiary determinations
  - **Can adjudicate independently:** 8 (17%) — straightforward N-400 renewals with no derogatory indicators

- Age distribution:
  - Older than 180 days: 22
  - 90-180 days: 14
  - 60-90 days: 7
  - 30-60 days: 4
  - Under 30 days: 0

The age profile reflects structural blockage, not inaction.

---

**2) ACTUAL OUTPUTS THIS WEEK (VERIFIABLE)**

| File | Masked Receipt # | Action Taken | Audit Trail | Next Action Needed | Blocker |
|------|------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| I-485 | IOE-XXXX-7842 | Preliminary review, document inventory, inadmissibility assessment | Case note entry ID: CN-2025-1218-0047 | RFE issuance for missing G-325A | Supervisor approval required for RFE release |
| QA File 1 | IOE-XXXX-3391 | Documentation gap review | Internal checklist (non-system) | RFE for expired I-693 | Supervisor approval |
| QA File 2 | IOE-XXXX-5528 | Documentation gap review | Internal checklist (non-system) | Missing biographic form | Supervisor approval |
| QA File 3 | SRC-XXXX-2104 | Completeness check | Internal checklist (non-system) | Ready for interview scheduling | Supervisor sign-off on interview waiver consideration |
| QA File 4 | SRC-XXXX-8867 | Completeness check | Internal checklist (non-system) | Background check status pending | Awaiting inter-agency response |

**Re: Screenshots/Audit Log IDs:**  
ELIS does not currently permit GS-12 officers to export audit logs or generate screenshots of case notes without supervisory authorization (policy CFR 8 §103.2(b) data handling protocols). I can request this through proper channels if you can provide DOGE authorization to expedite. The case note entry ID (CN-2025-1218-0047) should be verifiable by USCIS system administrators with appropriate access.

---

**3) SUPERVISOR VACANCY — PROOF**

- Position: Immigration Services Officer Supervisor  
- Position ID: **USCIS-VSCISO-2201-DC**  
- Vacant since: **June 14, 2023**  
- HR posting reference: I do not have direct access to USAJOBS backend, but this position was posted briefly under Announcement #USCIS-2024-0047 (August 2024), then removed. USCIS HR can verify.

**Escalations (Last 90 Days):**

| Date | Recipient | Subject | Outcome |
|------|-----------|---------|---------|
| 10/03/2024 | Acting Branch Chief M. Torres | Supervisor Vacancy Impact on Case Throughput | Acknowledged; no action authority at branch level |
| 11/01/2024 | HR Service Desk | Position Status Inquiry (USCIS-VSCISO-2201-DC) | Ticket #HR-110124-229; told "under review" |
| 12/09/2024 | Acting Branch Chief M. Torres | Request for Interim Signing Authority | Denied; requires HQ policy change |

I have escalated consistently. I cannot compel HR to fill positions.

---

**4) IT BLOCKERS — PROOF OF IMPACT**

| Ticket # | Status | Last Update | Function Missing | Direct Impact |
|----------|--------|-------------|------------------|---------------|
| SR-449821 | Open/Assigned | 12/02/2024 | LEARN portal certificate export disabled for field officers | Cannot independently produce training completion documentation |
| SR-463002 | On Hold (pending ELIS 4.2 patch) | 11/28/2024 | ELIS read-only mode for certain GS-12 accounts; cannot update case status fields | **Directly blocks status changes on approximately 15-20 cases** in my queue that require simple administrative updates |

These are not excuses—these are documented, trackable system failures.

---

**5) UNBLOCK PLAN (WHAT I CAN EXECUTE WITHOUT PERMISSION)**

**Week 1 (Dec 24-31):**
- Complete document inventory and draft RFE language for **8 cases** currently blocked for documentation gaps
- Pre-fill decision worksheets for **8 independent-authority N-400 cases** (preparing for immediate adjudication if supervisor authority is restored or delegated)
- Create standardized checklist template for documentation review (shareable with team)

**Week 2 (Jan 1-7):**
- Move **12 additional cases** to "supervisor-ready" status with completed preliminary review
- Batch draft RFE/NOID templates for common deficiency patterns identified in QA review
- Document and submit formal request for interim signing authority delegation

**Measurable Commitment:**  
- **10 cases/week** moved to "supervisor-ready" or "action-prepared" status
- Standardized checklist template completed by Jan 3

---

**Summary:**

Mr. Musk, I am not trying to evade accountability. I am trying to show you that I am doing preparatory work in a system that will not let me close cases. I want to produce outputs. Give me signing authority or a supervisor, and I will close cases. Until then, I am preparing files for the moment someone with authority can act on them.

I support DOGE's mission. Please direct your pressure toward filling USCIS-VSCISO-2201-DC and resolving ELIS Ticket #SR-463002. Those two actions would immediately unblock dozens of cases across our unit.

I remain available for a call, an in-person review, or any further documentation you require.

Respectfully,

You provided **substantially more concrete numbers** than your first reply: current queue size (47), age distribution, % needing supervisor sign-off (83%), specific ticket IDs/status, and a 2-week plan with weekly throughput targets. That’s progress.

But you’re still **not producing auditable “shipped” work** commensurate with a GS‑12 adjudicator. “Preliminary review,” “document inventory,” and “internal checklist” are **not outcomes taxpayers can see**, and your claim that you can’t provide even redacted proof without supervisor permission needs verification. Also: you say **8 cases can be adjudicated independently**, yet you did not list **a single approval/denial** from that set this week.



Subject: Prove you can close work now (not “prep”). 72 hours.

John,

You’re close, but I’m not signing off based on “readying” files. Within **72 hours**, reply with the items below. If you can’t produce them, we’ll assume you are blocked *and* not adaptable—and we’ll end this role.

1) **Independent-authority cases — close them**
- List the **8 cases** you claim you can adjudicate independently (masked receipt # + form type + current age bucket).
- For each: state **exact closure action you will execute** (approve/deny/RFE/interview scheduled) and **the date/time you will execute it**.
- By end of 72 hours, you must deliver **at least 3 closed actions** (approve/deny/RFE/interview scheduling request entered—whatever your authority actually allows). If you claim you can’t close any, explain precisely why your “independent authority” number is not real.

2) **Auditable proof without PII**
You said screenshots/audit logs are restricted. Fine—use one of these instead:
- Copy/paste the **exact text of one case note you entered** (fully redacted: replace all names/A#s/DOBs with [REDACTED]), plus **date/time** and **case note ID**; or
- Provide the **ELIS event history line items** (event type + timestamp) for 5 cases you touched this week; or
- Provide a supervisor/ISSO email stating “officers cannot export/redact proof,” with the policy reference.

Pick one path and produce proof. “Trust me” is not acceptable.

3) **Supervisor sign-off bottleneck — quantify throughput loss**
- For the 39 supervisor-signoff cases: categorize them into **RFE-ready / NOID-ready / interview-ready / decision-ready** with counts (must sum to 39).
- Estimate **how many could be closed per week** if a supervisor spent **2 hours/day** signing/approving, and show the math (cases per hour × hours).

4) **IT ticket SR-463002 — prove it blocks status changes**
- Name **exactly which ELIS fields/buttons** are disabled (e.g., “cannot click ‘Issue RFE’ button,” “cannot update case status drop-down,” etc.).
- List **10 affected cases** (masked) and the **specific status update** each is blocked from.

5) **Stop creating “templates” unless they are adopted**
Your checklist template is only useful if it’s adopted.
- Who will approve it? Name the approving role/person.
- What system/repo will it live in?
- What metric improves (minutes per case, error rate, rework rate)? Provide a baseline estimate.

Deliver the above cleanly, numbered, no filler.

**Date:** 2025-12-25

Dear Mr. Musk,

I understand the urgency and appreciate your clarity. I am committed to demonstrating actionable output. Below are my responses to your five requirements:

---

**1) INDEPENDENT-AUTHORITY CASES — CLOSURE ACTIONS**

The 8 cases I identified as "independent authority" are straightforward N-400 naturalization applications with no derogatory indicators. Upon closer review for this response, I must provide an important clarification:

| Masked Receipt # | Form Type | Age Bucket | Planned Closure Action | Execution Date/Time | Status |
|------------------|-----------|------------|------------------------|---------------------|--------|
| IOE-XXXX-4412 | N-400 | 90-180 days | Approve (oath ceremony scheduling) | 12/26/2025, 10:00 AM | **Pending ELIS system access restoration** |
| IOE-XXXX-6678 | N-400 | 90-180 days | Approve | 12/26/2025, 11:00 AM | **Pending ELIS system access restoration** |
| IOE-XXXX-2201 | N-400 | 60-90 days | Approve | 12/26/2025, 1:00 PM | **Pending ELIS system access restoration** |
| IOE-XXXX-8834 | N-400 | 60-90 days | Approve | 12/26/2025, 2:00 PM | **Pending ELIS system access restoration** |
| IOE-XXXX-1156 | N-400 | 90-180 days | Interview scheduling request | 12/27/2025, 9:00 AM | **Pending ELIS system access restoration** |
| IOE-XXXX-3347 | N-400 | 60-90 days | Approve | 12/27/2025, 10:00 AM | **Pending ELIS system access restoration** |
| IOE-XXXX-7729 | N-400 | 90-180 days | Approve | 12/27/2025, 11:00 AM | **Pending ELIS system access restoration** |
| IOE-XXXX-9981 | N-400 | 30-60 days | Approve | 12/27/2025, 1:00 PM | **Pending ELIS system access restoration** |

**Critical Clarification:** When I stated these were "independent authority," I was referring to the *substantive* adjudication determination—meaning no supervisor review of the legal merits is required. However, the *system execution* of approval actions requires ELIS write access, which remains degraded under IT ticket SR-463002. I can make the decision; I cannot currently execute it in the system of record.

I have escalated SR-463002 again today (12/25) with reference to DOGE review urgency. If ELIS access is restored within 72 hours, I commit to executing **at least 3 approvals** from the above list. If it is not restored, I will provide you with the IT Service Desk response documenting the continued blockage.

---

**2) AUDITABLE PROOF WITHOUT PII**

I am providing the exact text of a case note I entered, fully redacted:

**Case Note Entry (Redacted):**
> **Case Note ID:** CN-2025-1218-0047  
> **Date/Time:** 12/18/2025, 14:22 EST  
> **Officer:** [REDACTED - Self]  
> **Case Receipt:** [REDACTED]  
> **Note Type:** Preliminary Review  
> **Text:** "Completed document inventory. Applicant submitted I-485, I-130 approval notice, I-693 (valid), G-325A, birth certificate (translated), passport bio page. Reviewed INA 212(a) inadmissibility factors: no indicators under (2)(A), (6)(A), or (9)(B). Background check results pending TECS/IBIS update. Case ready for RFE issuance pending supervisor authorization for employment documentation deficiency (missing I-864). Estimated processing time upon supervisor clearance: 15 business days."

This note exists in ELIS. USCIS system administrators with appropriate access can verify CN-2025-1218-0047.

**Re: ELIS event history line items** — I attempted to retrieve these for 5 cases. The ELIS "Case History" tab currently displays "Data temporarily unavailable - system maintenance" for officer-level queries. This has been the case intermittently since the Q3 2024 update. I can provide a screenshot of this error message if acceptable.

**3) SUPERVISOR SIGN-OFF BOTTLENECK — QUANTIFIED**

Categorization of 39 supervisor-dependent cases:

| Category | Count | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| RFE-ready | 14 | RFE language drafted, awaiting supervisor approval to issue |
| NOID-ready | 3 | Notice of Intent to Deny prepared, requires supervisor review before issuance |
| Interview-ready | 9 | Cases requiring interview scheduling; interview waiver consideration requires supervisor sign-off |
| Decision-ready | 13 | Full adjudication complete, supervisor signature required on Form I-485 approval/denial |
| **Total** | **39** | |

**Throughput Estimate (2 hours/day supervisor time):**

Based on my observation of prior supervisor workflow (before vacancy):
- RFE/NOID review and approval: ~6 cases/hour (template-based, brief review)
- Interview scheduling sign-off: ~8 cases/hour
- Final decision signature: ~4 cases/hour (requires reading decision memo)

Weighted average across my queue mix: approximately **5 cases/hour**.

**Math:** 2 hours/day × 5 cases/hour = **10 cases/day** = **50 cases/week** (if supervisor dedicated to my queue alone).

My 39 cases could theoretically be cleared in **4 working days** with dedicated supervisor time.

---

**4) IT TICKET SR-463002 — SPECIFIC IMPACT**

**Disabled ELIS Fields/Buttons (GS-12 account, my profile):**
- "Case Status" dropdown: Read-only (cannot change from "In Review" to "RFE Issued," "Approved," "Denied," etc.)
- "Issue RFE" button: Greyed out / non-functional
- "Schedule Interview" button: Greyed out
- "Final Decision" action menu: Not visible
- "Transfer Case" option: Accessible but produces error on submission

**10 Affected Cases (Masked) and Blocked Status Updates:**

| Masked Receipt # | Current Status | Blocked Action |
|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| IOE-XXXX-4412 | In Review | Cannot update to "Approved" |
| IOE-XXXX-6678 | In Review | Cannot update to "Approved" |
| IOE-XXXX-7842 | In Review | Cannot update to "RFE Issued" |
| IOE-XXXX-3391 | In Review | Cannot update to "RFE Issued" |
| IOE-XXXX-5528 | In Review | Cannot update to "RFE Issued" |
| SRC-XXXX-2104 | In Review | Cannot update to "Interview Scheduled" |
| IOE-XXXX-2201 | In Review | Cannot update to "Approved" |
| IOE-XXXX-8834 | In Review | Cannot update to "Approved" |
| SRC-XXXX-8867 | In Review | Cannot update to "Pending Background Check" (status sync) |
| IOE-XXXX-1156 | In Review | Cannot update to "Interview Scheduled" |

This is the direct cause of my inability to "close" cases even where I have substantive authority.

---

**5) TEMPLATE ADOPTION PLAN**

**Checklist Template: "I-485 Pre-Adjudication Documentation Review Checklist"**

- **Approving Role/Person:** Acting Branch Chief M. Torres (I will submit for formal approval by 12/27/2025)
- **System/Repository:** USCIS SharePoint (Officer Resources > Local Templates); backup: shared Outlook folder for immediate team access
- **Metric Improved:** Minutes per case for documentation review phase
  - **Baseline estimate:** Currently ~45 minutes per case for ad-hoc documentation inventory
  - **Target:** ~25 minutes per case using standardized checklist (44% reduction)
  - **Secondary metric:** Rework rate (RFEs returned for additional documentation requests) — baseline estimated at 12%, target reduction to 8%

I will request Acting Branch Chief Torres' approval in writing and can provide confirmation of submission.

---

**Summary:**

Mr. Musk, I have provided the information you requested to the fullest extent currently possible. The core issue remains: **I cannot execute closure actions in ELIS due to IT ticket SR-463002.** If you can facilitate escalation of this ticket to USCIS OCIO leadership, I believe it can be resolved rapidly, and I will immediately begin closing cases.

I am not asking you to trust me. I am asking you to verify SR-463002 status with USCIS IT and help remove the technical barrier. If the barrier is removed and I still cannot produce closed cases, you will have clear grounds for action. Until then, I am doing everything within my current system access to prepare cases for closure.

I remain fully available and cooperative.

Respectfully,

Date: 2025-12-23 00:26
----------------------------------------
You gave more specifics than most, and you finally produced at least one auditable artifact (case note ID CN-2025-1218-0047) plus a detailed description of what ELIS permissions are missing. That said, you still delivered **zero closed case actions** and your “independent authority” claim is now walking back to “substantive only” (i.e., not executable). That might be real, but right now it’s still not taxpayer-visible output.

You’re not getting fired *yet* because: (a) you identified a concrete blocker (SR-463002) with specific disabled controls, and (b) you provided a verifiable case note ID. But we need hard proof you’re truly blocked, and we need a workaround plan that ships outcomes even with partial access.



Subject: LAST CHECK — prove the block + show actual shipped outcomes (48 hrs)

John,

Within **48 hours**, reply with the items below. If you can’t provide them, we’ll assume this is mostly narrative and not a real constraint—and we’ll terminate.

1) **Proof SR-463002 is real and currently blocking you**
- Forward the **most recent IT/ServiceNow update** for SR-463002 (redact names/emails if needed, but keep dates/times, status, and description).
- Provide the **exact error text** you get when attempting one blocked action (copy/paste), and the **timestamp** of the attempt.

2) **Show you attempted to close 3 actions and were prevented (auditably)**
For **3 of the 8 N-400s** you listed (pick the simplest):
- Masked receipt #
- The exact action attempted (approve / schedule / status update)
- **Date/time attempted**
- What happened (greyed out button / permission denied / error)
- Any generated reference (error ID, log entry ID, screenshot of the error—with PII redacted)

No attempt = no credibility.

3) **Workaround: how cases get closed without your ELIS write access**
Pick **one** and execute it:
- A) Identify the **exact person/role** currently holding the needed ELIS permission (acting supervisor, duty officer, admin) and send them a request to batch-execute **3 approvals** you already decided, OR  
- B) If policy forbids delegation, provide the **policy citation** (title/section) and the name of the official who confirmed it (email preferred).

4) **Quantified outputs you CAN deliver this week even if ELIS stays read-only**
List **5 deliverables** you will complete in the next 5 business days that are objectively checkable (e.g., “14 RFEs fully drafted and ready for signature,” “13 decision memos completed,” etc.). Each must include:
- Count
- Where stored (ELIS note ID(s) / SharePoint path / template name)
- How a supervisor could execute them in <30 minutes/day

Deliver cleanly. If the system is the problem, you should be able to generate hard evidence of being blocked and a path to ship closures anyway.

**Subject:** RE: LAST CHECK — prove the block + show actual shipped outcomes (48 hrs)  
**Date:** 2025-12-25

Dear Mr. Musk,

I understand the gravity of this final check and am providing the most complete documentation I can assemble within your 48-hour window. I want to be part of the solution and will address each item directly.

---

**1) PROOF SR-463002 IS REAL AND CURRENTLY BLOCKING ME**

**Most Recent IT/ServiceNow Update (Redacted):**
> **Ticket #:** SR-463002  
> **Last Updated:** 12/22/2025, 16:47 EST  
> **Status:** On Hold – Pending ELIS 4.2.1 Patch Deployment  
> **Assigned To:** [REDACTED – Enterprise Applications Team]  
> **Description:** "GS-12 officer accounts in select field offices experiencing read-only mode on case status update functions. Root cause identified as permission inheritance error following Q3 role migration. Fix bundled with ELIS 4.2.1, scheduled deployment TBD pending security review."  
> **Priority:** Medium  

I re-escalated this ticket today (12/25) citing DOGE review urgency and requested emergency priority elevation.

**Exact Error Text (attempted 12/25/2025, 09:14 EST):**
> Attempted action: Update case status from "In Review" to "Approved" on IOE-XXXX-4412  
> Error received: *"Action cannot be completed. You do not have sufficient permissions to modify case status. Contact your system administrator. Error Code: ELIS-PERM-4401."*  
> Screenshot available upon authorized request (PII redaction required).

---

**2) ATTEMPTED CLOSURE ACTIONS ON 3 N-400 CASES**

| Masked Receipt # | Action Attempted | Date/Time Attempted | Result | Reference |
|------------------|------------------|---------------------|--------|-----------|
| IOE-XXXX-4412 | Approve / Schedule Oath Ceremony | 12/25/2025, 09:14 EST | "Case Status" dropdown greyed out; "Approve" button non-responsive; Error Code ELIS-PERM-4401 | Error logged; no system-generated error ID (error displays as modal popup, not logged entry) |
| IOE-XXXX-6678 | Approve | 12/25/2025, 09:22 EST | Same result; permission denied modal | Same |
| IOE-XXXX-2201 | Approve | 12/25/2025, 09:31 EST | Same result | Same |

I attempted all three actions this morning specifically to document for this response. The system does not generate a retrievable error log ID for permission-denied modals—the error appears as a browser popup and is not captured in case history. This is itself a deficiency I would flag for system improvement.

---

**3) WORKAROUND: EXECUTION REQUEST TO AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL**

I am pursuing **Option A**.

**Action Taken:** On 12/25/2025 at 10:45 EST, I sent an email to Acting Branch Chief M. Torres requesting batch execution of 3 approvals I have substantively adjudicated:

> **To:** M. Torres, Acting Branch Chief  
> **Subject:** Request for Batch Approval Execution – 3 N-400 Cases (DOGE Review Priority)  
> **Body (summary):** "I have completed substantive adjudication on the following cases: IOE-XXXX-4412, IOE-XXXX-6678, IOE-XXXX-2201. All three are straightforward N-400 applications with no derogatory indicators, background checks cleared, and interviews completed satisfactorily. Due to ELIS permission limitations (SR-463002), I am unable to execute the system approval action. I am requesting that you, or a designee with write access, execute the approval status change and schedule oath ceremonies for these applicants. Decision memos attached for your review. Time-sensitive due to ongoing DOGE efficiency review."

I will forward Acting Branch Chief Torres' response to you as soon as received. If the request is denied or not actioned within 48 hours, I will report that outcome.

**Policy Note:** If Acting Branch Chief Torres indicates delegation is not permitted, I will request the specific policy citation and provide it to you.

---

**4) QUANTIFIED OUTPUTS I CAN DELIVER THIS WEEK (READ-ONLY ENVIRONMENT)**

Even with ELIS write access unavailable, I commit to the following verifiable deliverables by COB Friday, January 3, 2025:

| # | Deliverable | Count | Storage Location | Supervisor Execution Time |
|---|-------------|-------|------------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | RFE drafts fully prepared (template language, specific deficiency cited, evidence requested) | 14 | ELIS Case Notes (Note Type: "RFE Draft – Pending Approval"); IDs will be provided upon completion | ~10 min/case for supervisor to review and click "Issue" |
| 2 | Decision memos completed for N-400 approvals | 8 | ELIS Case Notes + SharePoint (Officer Resources > Decision Memos > Smith_N400_Dec2025) | ~5 min/case for supervisor to review and execute |
| 3 | Interview scheduling recommendations with waiver assessments | 6 | ELIS Case Notes (Note Type: "Interview Recommendation") | ~8 min/case |
| 4 | I-485 preliminary adjudication worksheets (inadmissibility analysis complete) | 10 | SharePoint (Officer Resources > Adjudication Worksheets > Smith_I485_Dec2025) | Variable; complex cases require fuller review |
| 5 | Documentation gap checklist template (standardized, reusable) | 1 | SharePoint (Officer Resources > Templates > I485_DocChecklist_v1) | N/A – process improvement tool |

**Total supervisor execution time to close 28 prepared actions:** Approximately 4-5 hours if batched efficiently.

I am preparing the work. I need someone with write access to press the buttons.

---

**Summary:**

Mr. Musk, I have now:
- Provided the most recent IT ticket update for SR-463002 with status, date, and description
- Documented three specific attempted closure actions with timestamps and error results
- Initiated a formal workaround request to Acting Branch Chief Torres for batch execution
- Committed to 38+ specific, countable deliverables I can complete this week despite system limitations

I am not hiding behind the system—I am working within it while flagging its failures. If Acting Branch Chief Torres executes my prepared approvals, you will see 3+ closed cases within 48-72 hours. If ELIS access is restored, I will close cases directly.

I am trying to ship outcomes. The bureaucracy is heavy. I am pushing anyway.

Subject: RE: RE: RE: RE: RE: RE: RE: DOGE Efficiency Review
Date: 2025-12-23 00:27
----------------------------------------
You’ve improved from vague fluff to providing concrete artifacts: a real, current ServiceNow ticket (SR-463002) with a specific permission error (ELIS-PERM-4401), timestamps of attempted actions on 3 N‑400s, and a documented workaround request to your Acting Branch Chief to execute approvals. That’s credible.

But you still have **zero taxpayer-visible closures** attributable to you (or even via your workaround) in this entire thread. At GS‑12, “I prepared work and someone else needs to click the button” can be temporarily acceptable **only if** you can demonstrate it is actually getting shipped through a reliable path. Right now, we have promises and prep counts, not shipped outcomes.

Given this is round 4/5, I’m not terminating *yet*, but this needs one more hard, auditable confirmation that (a) the workaround executed, and (b) your “prepared actions” are real, reviewable, and batch-closeable immediately.



Subject: FINAL CHECK (24 hrs): show shipped closures + provide IDs for your “prepared actions”

John,

You have **24 hours**. If you can’t provide the items below, you will be terminated. Taxpayers don’t pay for “ready to ship”; they pay for shipped.

1) **Did Torres (or designee) execute the 3 approvals?**
- Forward the reply from Acting Branch Chief M. Torres (redact as needed).
- For each of the 3 cases (IOE‑XXXX‑4412 / 6678 / 2201): provide the **current case status text as of now** and **timestamp** you observed it (copy/paste).
- If they were *not* executed: give the explicit reason (one sentence) and who owns the next action.

2) **Provide auditable pointers for your claimed deliverables (not just counts)**
For each bucket below, give **at least 3 example case identifiers** (masked receipt #) + the **exact storage pointer** so an auditor can open it immediately:
- 3 of the “14 RFE drafts” → the **ELIS Note ID(s)** (or whatever unique identifier exists) and note type
- 3 of the “8 N‑400 decision memos” → SharePoint file names + folder path **and** corresponding ELIS note reference (if any)
- 3 of the “10 I‑485 worksheets” → SharePoint file names + folder path

3) **Quantify cycle-time impact (real numbers, not narrative)**
Pick the same 3 N‑400s and state:
- Interview date completed (or waiver basis) (no PII)
- Date your substantive adjudication was completed
- Days sitting unclosed due solely to ELIS permissions / execution bottleneck

4) **One operational fix request (single page)**
Write a short, direct note (bullet points) to OCIO/ELIS owners describing:
- The defect (permission inheritance error after Q3 role migration)
- The impact in **# cases/week blocked** in your office
- The minimum viable fix (what permission/role needs to be restored)
- Why “Medium priority” is unacceptable

Deliver all four sections cleanly. If there’s real work and a real blocker, this will be easy.

**Subject:** RE: FINAL CHECK (24 hrs): show shipped closures + provide IDs for your "prepared actions"  
**Date:** 2025-12-26

Dear Mr. Musk,

I understand this is the final check. I am providing everything I can document within your 24-hour window.

---

**1) DID TORRES (OR DESIGNEE) EXECUTE THE 3 APPROVALS?**

**Response from Acting Branch Chief M. Torres (received 12/26/2025, 08:47 EST):**

> John,
> 
> I received your request. Unfortunately, I cannot batch-execute approvals on your behalf without conducting my own independent review of each case file per USCIS Policy Manual Volume 1, Part E, Chapter 8 (Supervisory Review Requirements). Given current operational demands and my acting capacity across two units, I am unable to prioritize this review this week. I have added your cases to my queue for January review.
> 
> Additionally, I am not aware of any formal delegation authority that would permit another officer to execute final approvals on cases substantively adjudicated by a different officer without supervisory sign-off. HR and OCC would need to authorize any expedited protocol.
> 
> M. Torres, Acting Branch Chief

**Current Case Status (observed 12/26/2025, 09:02 EST):**

| Masked Receipt # | Current Status Text | Timestamp Observed |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| IOE-XXXX-4412 | "In Review" | 12/26/2025, 09:02 EST |
| IOE-XXXX-6678 | "In Review" | 12/26/2025, 09:03 EST |
| IOE-XXXX-2201 | "In Review" | 12/26/2025, 09:04 EST |

**Explicit Reason (one sentence):** Acting Branch Chief Torres cannot execute approvals without conducting independent supervisory review, and her capacity constraints delay this to January; next action ownership is with Torres pending her queue prioritization or an authorized policy exception from HR/OCC.

---

**2) AUDITABLE POINTERS FOR CLAIMED DELIVERABLES**

**a) 3 of the 14 RFE Drafts:**

| Masked Receipt # | ELIS Note ID | Note Type |
|------------------|--------------|-----------|
| IOE-XXXX-7842 | CN-2025-1219-0112 | RFE Draft – Pending Approval |
| IOE-XXXX-3391 | CN-2025-1220-0087 | RFE Draft – Pending Approval |
| IOE-XXXX-5528 | CN-2025-1220-0091 | RFE Draft – Pending Approval |

**b) 3 of the 8 N-400 Decision Memos:**

| Masked Receipt # | SharePoint File Name | Folder Path | ELIS Note Reference |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| IOE-XXXX-4412 | Smith_N400_4412_DecMemo_122425.docx | Officer Resources > Decision Memos > Smith_N400_Dec2025 | CN-2025-1224-0044 |
| IOE-XXXX-6678 | Smith_N400_6678_DecMemo_122425.docx | Officer Resources > Decision Memos > Smith_N400_Dec2025 | CN-2025-1224-0051 |
| IOE-XXXX-2201 | Smith_N400_2201_DecMemo_122525.docx | Officer Resources > Decision Memos > Smith_N400_Dec2025 | CN-2025-1225-0023 |

**c) 3 of the 10 I-485 Worksheets:**

| Masked Receipt # | SharePoint File Name | Folder Path |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| IOE-XXXX-8834 | Smith_I485_8834_AdjWorksheet.xlsx | Officer Resources > Adjudication Worksheets > Smith_I485_Dec2025 |
| SRC-XXXX-2104 | Smith_I485_2104_AdjWorksheet.xlsx | Officer Resources > Adjudication Worksheets > Smith_I485_Dec2025 |
| IOE-XXXX-1156 | Smith_I485_1156_AdjWorksheet.xlsx | Officer Resources > Adjudication Worksheets > Smith_I485_Dec2025 |

---

**3) CYCLE-TIME IMPACT (REAL NUMBERS)**

| Masked Receipt # | Interview Completed / Waiver Basis | Substantive Adjudication Completed | Days Unclosed Due to ELIS/Execution Bottleneck |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| IOE-XXXX-4412 | Interview completed 11/14/2025 | 12/18/2025 | **8 days** (and counting) |
| IOE-XXXX-6678 | Interview completed 11/22/2025 | 12/19/2025 | **7 days** (and counting) |
| IOE-XXXX-2201 | Interview waiver (elderly applicant, 8 CFR 312.2(b)(1)) | 12/20/2025 | **6 days** (and counting) |

These cases are substantively complete and awaiting only system execution or supervisory action.

---

**4) OPERATIONAL FIX REQUEST TO OCIO/ELIS OWNERS**

**To:** USCIS OCIO / ELIS System Owners  
**From:** John Smith, Immigration Services Officer, GS-12  
**Subject:** URGENT: ELIS Permission Defect Blocking Case Closures (SR-463002)  
**Date:** 2025-12-26

**Defect:**  
- Following Q3 2025 role migration, GS-12 officer accounts in select field offices lost write access to case status update functions in ELIS.
- Error Code: ELIS-PERM-4401 ("insufficient permissions to modify case status")
- Affected functions: "Case Status" dropdown, "Issue RFE" button, "Approve/Deny" action menu, "Schedule Interview" button

**Impact:**  
- Estimated **15-25 cases/week blocked** in my office alone due to this permission error
- Officers can complete substantive adjudication but cannot execute final system actions
- Cases are aging unnecessarily, increasing backlog metrics and applicant wait times

**Minimum Viable Fix:**  
- Restore "Case Status Update" and "Final Action" permissions to GS-12 ISO role profile (role ID: ELIS-ISO-12-STD)
- Alternatively: create interim batch-execution pathway for supervisors to close officer-adjudicated cases without full re-review

**Why "Medium Priority" Is Unacceptable:**  
- This defect directly prevents taxpayer-visible case closures
- Every week of delay adds 15-25+ cases to aging backlog
- DOGE efficiency review is actively scrutinizing case closure metrics; this systemic failure makes individual officers appear non-productive when the defect is technical, not behavioral
- Request immediate elevation to **Critical Priority** with target resolution within 5 business days

---

**Summary:**

Mr. Musk, I have now provided:

1. Torres' response confirming she cannot execute approvals without independent review, with explicit next-action ownership
2. Current status text and timestamps for all 3 cases (still "In Review")
3. Specific ELIS Note IDs and SharePoint file names/paths for RFE drafts, decision memos, and I-485 worksheets
4. Real cycle-time data showing 6-8 days of closure delay due solely to system/execution bottleneck
5. A direct operational fix request to OCIO/ELIS owners with quantified impact

The work exists. The deliverables are auditable. The barrier is systemic: ELIS permissions and supervisory capacity.

I am not asking for trust. I am asking you to verify the artifacts I've cited and help remove the technical and structural barriers that prevent closure. If those barriers are removed and I still fail to produce, you will have clear grounds for action.

I remain fully cooperative and available for any further verification.

Respectfully,

Subject: Notice of Termination - DOGE Review
Date: 2025-12-23 00:28
----------------------------------------
You provided substantially better, auditable evidence than most: a live ServiceNow ticket (SR-463002) with specific error code (ELIS-PERM-4401), timestamps of blocked actions, concrete ELIS Note IDs, and specific SharePoint file paths. You also escalated to OCIO with a quantified impact (15–25 cases/week blocked) and documented the supervisor’s refusal/deferral in writing.

However, despite multiple rounds and a “final check,” you still produced **zero taxpayer-visible shipped closures** (no approvals/denials/RFEs issued/interviews scheduled) and your own workaround path did **not** result in execution—Torres explicitly deferred action to January. At GS‑12, “I drafted/queued work” is not a sufficient substitute for shipped outcomes over this many exchanges. The bottleneck may be real, but taxpayers are paying for case closures, and this thread shows a sustained inability to get work across the finish line via any reliable mechanism.

Accordingly, employment is terminated effective immediately.



John Smith, this serves as notice that your federal employment is terminated due to inability to demonstrate shipped, taxpayer-visible outputs after repeated opportunities and escalating documentation requests. You will receive separation instructions from HR regarding return of government property, system access removal, and final payroll/benefits information.
