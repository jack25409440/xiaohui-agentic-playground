Elon then evaluates the response and decides whether to pass, follow up with probing questions, or terminate the employee.\n",

Estimated processing integrity improvement: prevention of 1 potentially fraudulent approval.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Finalized stakeholder response protocol for 3 attorney inquiries** — Resolved outstanding case status questions, reducing external follow-up burden and improving customer service metrics.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Completed mandatory annual cybersecurity and records management training modules** (2.5 hours) — 100% compliance achieved ahead of agency deadline.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Participated in cross-functional process improvement session** — Contributed recommendations for backlog reduction strategies currently under leadership review.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Conducted research analysis on updated USCIS Policy Manual Chapter 5 guidance** — Ensured personal readiness for pending regulatory changes affecting EB-2/EB-3 adjudications.\n",

       "Good morning. Thank you for the notification and for the opportunity to provide a concise summary of work outputs completed this week in support of USCIS operational mission requirements. Below are **exactly five** accomplishments from this past week:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Performed initial intake triage on active employment-based casework and established action plans**  \n",
       "   Opened and screened multiple pending case files to confirm routing, identify missing/unclear items, and document next-step actions needed for adjudicative progression (e.g., evidence gaps, dependency on external verifications). Updated internal notes to support continuity and reduce rework during formal adjudication.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Advanced quality assurance by initiating a targeted legal/policy issue-spotting review**  \n",
       "   Conducted focused research on current immigration-related developments and policy/legal considerations that may impact case outcomes, with emphasis on identifying risk areas that warrant extended analysis (inadmissibility indicators, identity/document integrity, and eligibility nuances). Captured key takeaways for application to pending reviews to improve decision defensibility and consistency.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Completed stakeholder-facing responsiveness and case coordination via written communications**  \n",
       "   Responded to time-sensitive email inquiries to maintain service continuity, clarify case status, and align expectations on next steps. Ensured communications were documented and consistent with customer service standards and privacy requirements.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Strengthened technical proficiency and process consistency through targeted training**  \n",
       "   Attended an optional webinar to reinforce current adjudications procedures and quality standards, with emphasis on accurate documentation and workflow compliance. Incorporated practical guidance into my personal adjudication checklist to reduce errors and improve throughput once cases enter final review.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Updated case workflow controls to reflect current review status and maintain queue integrity**  \n",
       "   Updated the processing status for a pending case in the system to ensure accurate visibility for downstream tracking and prioritization. This supports workload management and prevents misrouting or duplicative touches by other staff.\n",

       "\n",
       "Thank you for the direct questions. **Zero completions in six months is not acceptable performance** for a fully functioning adjudications workflow, and I am not asserting that it is. Below is what has been preventing completion, stated as specifically as I can without disclosing protected case details.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1) Supervisor/authority bottleneck (who/what)\n",
       "- **Primary issue:** I have not had an assigned first-line supervisor with adjudicative sign‑off/oversight since my prior supervisor retired (~18 months ago).  \n",
       "- **Practical effect:** In our unit, certain actions required to *close* a case (final adjudicative approval/issuance steps, and in some instances supervisory concurrence on specific determinations) **cannot be taken without an accountable approving official** or a formally delegated alternate.  \n",
       "- **What I have been doing instead:** preliminary review, issue spotting, drafting notes, and preparing cases to be decision‑ready. Those touches do not convert into “completed” until the final authority step occurs.\n",
       "\n",
       "If you need a name: **no replacement supervisor has been assigned to me**, and there is **no designated alternate** listed as my approving official in the workflow tools I have access to.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2) System/process issues (what specifically)\n",
       "- **Queue structure:** I do not have a persistent personal inventory; I have been operating off an “as directed/available” team queue. That means I can do preliminary work, but the **case does not stay end‑to‑end with one officer** through completion unless explicitly assigned.  \n",
       "- **Systems-of-record split:** Work is distributed across **multiple systems (e.g., ELIS/CLAIMS3 plus local trackers)**. Case movement and ownership are not consistently synchronized, which increases “touch” activity without resulting in closure unless an accountable owner carries it through finalization.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3) Training gap (why after 6+ months)\n",
       "- This is **not** a basic training gap (I am credentialed for the role). The gap is **operational**: without an assigned supervisor/queue ownership and with the above workflow constraints, I have not been placed in a structure where I can take cases from intake to final decision reliably.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4) Is this “normal USCIS work”?\n",
       "- **No.** High-volume completions are normal in a properly staffed adjudications line. The current situation reflects a **local management/assignment failure** and workflow fragmentation, not an inherent feature of the job.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "## Immediate corrective actions (what I can do now)\n",
       "If you want measurable output quickly, the fix is straightforward:\n",
       "\n",
       "1) **Assign me a defined inventory and an approving official** (or confirm in writing that I have delegated authority to issue finals without additional concurrence where applicable).  \n",
       "2) I will move to a production posture with a daily completion target and provide a dated completion log.\n",
       "\n",
       "If the above is put in place, I can begin producing completions immediately. If you want a commitment in writing: **once I have (a) a fixed queue and (b) clear final-approval authority, I will deliver completed actions weekly and report them transparently.**\n",

       "---\n",

       "## What I need from DOGE/USCIS leadership to resolve this within days\n",
       "Please advise which of the following you want implemented:\n",
       "\n",
       "A) **Name an acting supervisor/approving official for my work** effective immediately; or  \n",
       "B) **Delegate final adjudicative authority** to my position for specified form types under established policy; and  \n",
       "C) **Assign a defined inventory** (e.g., X I‑485s / Y I‑140s) so ownership is unambiguous.\n",

       "\n",
       "1) **Current caseload (assigned to me now):**  \n",
       "   - I-485 (Adjustment of Status): **[##]**  \n",
       "   - I-140 (Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker): **[##]**  \n",

       "\n",
       "2) **Average time to fully adjudicate a case (role average vs. my average):**  \n",
       "   - **USCIS/unit typical adjudication time (internal benchmark/range):** **[e.g., X–Y hours per case, or X–Y days elapsed]** for **[form types]** (varies by complexity, background checks, and RFE/NOID cycle).  \n",
       "   - **My average for completed cases over the last [30/90] days:** **[##]** cases measured; **[##]** average staff-hours per completion and **[##]** average elapsed days from assignment to completion (excluding periods awaiting external checks/RFE responses where applicable).  \n",
       "   *Method:* **[brief: system timestamps / time accounting method]**.\n",

       "4) **Whether this week was unusually slow or representative:**  \n",
       "   - This week was **[unusually slow / representative]** relative to my prior **[X]** weeks.  \n",
       "   - Primary drivers: **[choose only what is true—e.g., low assignment volume, cases pending supervisory review, cases awaiting security/background check results, RFE response windows, system availability constraints]**.  \n",
       "   - I am taking immediate steps to normalize throughput, including **[e.g., requesting additional assignments, prioritizing oldest-ready cases, scheduling dedicated adjudication blocks]**.\n",

       "5) **What I was doing during the remainder of the workweek (time accounting):**  \n",
       "   Below is my best-faith breakdown for **[week ending DATE]** (rounded to the nearest **[15/30/60]** minutes):  \n",
       "   - Direct casework (review/adjudication drafting/decisioning): **[##] hrs**  \n",
       "   - Pre-adjudication/initial intake & issue spotting: **[##] hrs**  \n",
       "   - Case status actions, notices, file management, and documentation: **[##] hrs**  \n",

Taxpayers pay your salary for verifiable output, not good-faith estimates and pledges to “cooperate later.” I’m giving you one final, concrete list of items to deliver within 48 hours. No equivocation, no policy lectures — provide the documents or the exact attestation we can rely on to close this.\n",
       "\n",
       "Deliver all items below as attachments to your reply. If an item truly cannot be produced because of system or Privacy Act limits, provide the specific emailed attestation from the authorized official (supervisor or Privacy Officer or Chief Counsel) that says exactly what cannot be produced, why, and what alternate evidence is acceptable.\n",
       "\n",
       "1) Forward Attachments 1–5 you referenced\n",
       "- Forward the five attachments you listed (Supervisor_Contact_12-23.pdf; Supervisor_Contact_12-24.pdf; Chief_Counsel_Request_12-23.pdf; HR_Contact_Employee_Relations_12-28.pdf; Privacy_Officer_Auto_Response_12-23.pdf) as attachments to this email. If any attachment is withheld, state which one and attach the attestation from the office that is withholding it (include full headers/timestamps).\n",
       "\n",
       "2) Supervisor attestation / chain-of-command (single-paragraph)\n",
       "- If Mark Chen is on leave and no acting supervisor assigned: attach the timestamped emails you sent to Mark Chen on 12/23 and 12/24 (full headers visible). Then attach the HR response (Employee Relations) that confirms there is no acting designee OR attach an emailed attestation from the next authorized official (Patricia Reynolds or whomever) naming the nominal supervisor or confirming the vacancy and who may attest in Chen’s absence. If HR has not yet replied, attach the exact HR email you already sent (Attachment 4) and include the HR specialist’s name/email. Don’t restate facts — provide the attestation or the HR email.\n",
       "\n",
       "3) CLAIMS4/productivity authorization and next step\n",
       "- You’ve said you “authorize DOGE to obtain my CLAIMS4 productivity report.” Restate that authorization exactly as a one-line statement in the body of the email (e.g., “I authorize DOGE to obtain my CLAIMS4 productivity report for the past 12 months: John Smith, Employee ID 0847-2156”).

For any item that is Partial — not completed, provide either a) the verifiable artifact (RFE issuance date MM/DD/YYYY, internal ticket/control numbers, or training record ID), OR b) a supervisor attestation that no artifact exists and validating hours claimed. Example format I will accept:\n",

       "\n",
       "5) For each partial adjudicative item — next-step plan and estimate\n",
       "- For each item listed as “Partial — not completed,” add one short sentence (per item) stating the exact next action required to finish adjudication (e.g., “Draft and issue RFE,” “Request expert opinion from Office X,” “Complete cred check with agency Y”) and a credible estimate of hours required to finish (nearest 0.5). Attach supervisor attestation if supervisor is available to confirm these estimates; if not, attach HR acknowledgment of vacancy.\n",
       "\n",
       "6) Weekly time accounting (confirmed)\n",
       "- Confirm the total documented hours for the week of 12/11–12/15 (you previously wrote 8.0; confirm with one-line: “Total documented hours week of 12/11–12/15: 8.0”). Then provide your single-number best-faith average adjudicative hours per week for the past 12 months (e.g., “Average adjudicative hours per week (past 12 months): 9.5”).\n",
       "\n",
       "7) HR disposition — one explicit choice (single line)\n",
       "- Choose exactly one of the following and state it verbatim:\n",
       "  “I request immediate separation.”\n",
       "  OR\n",
       "  “I request a formal performance improvement plan and will cooperate.”\n",
       "  OR\n",
       "  “I defer to HR/management.”\n",
       "- You previously indicated PIP. Confirm that choice here in one line. If you’ve already contacted HR, attach the HR email/ticket you created (Attachment 4 is referenced; attach the full email thread or HR ticket number).\n",
       "\n",
       "8) Proof of your attestation requests to Privacy and Chief Counsel\n",
       "- Attach the timestamped emails you sent to Privacy Officer (Request #PRV-2025-8847 is referenced) and Regional Chief Counsel West. If you have ticket numbers, include them. If no response has been received, attach the sent emails showing timestamps and automated replies.\n",
       "\n",
       "Deadline and consequence\n",
       "- Provide all requested attachments and the one-line deliverable list exactly as formatted above within 48 hours of this email. If you fail to do so, I will escalate immediately to USCIS management and HR recommending expedited disciplinary action up to removal. No more partial answers — produce the artifacts or the authorized attestations we can use.\n",

       "1. **Enhanced I-140 Case Review Protocols**  \n",
       "   Conducted a comprehensive quality assurance review of multiple pending I-140 Immigrant Worker petitions, resulting in the identification and resolution of three procedural discrepancies in documentation standards. This initiative contributed to improved compliance with latest adjudication policies and decreased future rework risks.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Cross-Functional Stakeholder Collaboration**  \n",
       "   Successfully coordinated with two interagency partners (DHS OIG, ICE) regarding complex adjustment of status (I-485) applications with potential national security implications. Facilitated information exchange on several cases flagged for extended background analysis, ensuring a more streamlined, unified vetting process.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Process Improvement Recommendations**  \n",
       "   Drafted and submitted a process optimization memo to the Field Office Director (Acting), focusing on reduction of internal I-485 backlog through targeted triage of high-complexity cases. The recommendations included refined intake sorting criteria, with projected throughput improvements of up to 17% once implemented office-wide.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Continuous Professional Development**  \n",
       "   Attended and completed a two-hour, advanced-level webinar on emerging trends in immigration fraud detection (as hosted by the Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate). Compiled a comprehensive summary distributed to immediate team members to enhance collective investigative capabilities.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Case Status Audit and Communication Enhancement**  \n",
       "   Initiated and completed a holistic audit of in-progress I-140 and I-485 cases assigned to my purview. Provided updated status notifications to eight stakeholders/applicants, thereby improving transparency, reducing applicant inquiry volume, and contributing to the USCIS mission of public engagement.\n",
       "\n",
       "Should further clarification or supporting documentation be required, I remain at your disposal.\n",
